# Hi there!
This is a simple scripting language ReDe

# Syntax
Rede simply consists of 4 things:
 - variables
 - numbers
 - strings
 - functions

## Variables
To define a variable just write its name and assign a value to it:
```python
numberVariable = 33
stringVariable = "Hi!"
anotherStringVariable = 'Hello!'
```

## Functions
In ReDe you cant define your own functions, you can only use provided functions from the environment, but function calls themselves are easy:
```ts
sum = sum(1 2)
log(sum)
```
Function arguments are divided by any whitespace
