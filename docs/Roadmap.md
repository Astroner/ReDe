# ReDe roadmap
 - [x] Design bytecode and document it - [Bytecode specification](https://github.com/Astroner/ReDe/blob/master/docs/Bytecode.md)
 - [x] Implement bytecode runtime - *RedeRuntime.h*
 - [x] Design the language
 - [x] Implement the compiler - *RedeCompiler.h*
 - [x] Implement STD library - *RedeSTD.h*
 - [x] Wrap everything into the general lib - *Rede.h*
 - [x] Implement simple CLI runtime with an ability to write code line-by-line
     - Root file -  *cli/src/main.c*
     - Build executable - ```make build-cli```
 - [x] Implement the ability to compile bytecode from file source
 - [ ] Implement **RedeDist** structure to separate compilation into buffer and into file
 - [ ] Implement the ability to compile into .rd file
 - [ ] Implement the ability to execute bytecode from .rd files
 - [ ] Improve CLI tool to use new file features
 - [ ] Implement if-statements on bytecode level
 - [ ] Implement if-statements on compiler level
 - [ ] Improve runtime strings management (Probably apply Baal.h to do block-by-block allocation)
 - [ ] Implement the ability to compile into .c files
